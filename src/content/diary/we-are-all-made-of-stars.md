we are all made of stars. all the chemical elements had been created by nuclear fusions that take place in the stars. in the very beginning there had only been hydrogen and helium. thanks to the nuclear fusions the number of them was growing. when the fusion stops, the core of a star undergoes collapse and creates the supernova explosion. all the elements spread in the universe. carbon spreads in the universe. carbon is the chemical basis of life. so we are all made of stars.
